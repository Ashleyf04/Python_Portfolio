# Programming Languages Review Prompts

## 1) Explain how a computer might break down a complex task, such as calculating your grade,  into a series of simple operations.
A computer breaks down a complex task like calculating your grade by dividing it into simple operations such as retrieving scores, applying weights, adding results, and comparing totals to grading criteria.
## 2) What is an instruction list?
An instruction list is a set of commands or statements that the interpreter executes step by step to perform a specific task.
## 3) What is a program?
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform specific tasks or solve particular problems.
## 4) Describe how computing devices physically store data.
Computing devices physically store data by representing information as  patterns of electrical charges, magnetic orientations, or optical marks on storage media such as hard drives, solid-state drives, or optical discs.
## 5) Explain how a computing device would store numerical data.
A computing device stores numerical data by converting numbers into binary code and recording the corresponding patterns of electrical signals, magnetic states, or electronic charges on its storage medium.
## 6) Explain how a computing device would store a character.
A computing device stores a character by converting it into a numeric code using a character encoding systen (like an ASCII Table) then representing that code as a binary pattern on its storage medium.
## 7) Explain how a computing device would store the color of a pixel.
A computing device stored the color of a pixel by representing its RGB (Red, Green, Blue) intensity values as binary numbers and recording these values in a memory or storage.
## 8) Describe what machine language is.
Machine language is the lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary code (0's and 1's) that a computer can execute.
## 9) Describe what natural languages are and provide at least two examples of a natural language.
Natural languages are languages that have developed naturally among humans for communication, such as English and Spanish.
## 10) Describe what a low level programming language is and provide at least two examples of a low level programming language.
Low-level programming language invloves writing code that communicates closely with a computer's hardware, often requiring detailed management of memory and processor instructions; Ex: Assembly and C
## 11) Describe what a high level programming language is and provide at least two examples of a high level programming language.
High-level programming involves writing code using languages that are closer to human language and abstract away most hardware details, making development easier; Ex: Java and Python.
## 12) Rank the following types of languages in order from most human friendly (least computer friendly) to most computer friendly (least human friendly): Asssembly Language, Natural Language, Machine Language, High Level Programming Language, Low Level Programming Language.

## 13) What are the four fundamental elements of language?  Describe each.  Where appropriate, include examples in your descriptions.
